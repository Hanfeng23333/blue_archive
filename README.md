  I am a crazy fan of the Blue Archive and I hope to create a program that simulates drawing cards, but I cannot save all the images of students on my own computer, which is not conducive to remote access. Also I currently don't have the financial means to rent a server, so I want to make use of GitHub's repository function to help me store these images and return them when I need them.
